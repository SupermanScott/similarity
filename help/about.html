The Similarity Objects module is a tool for configuring similarity
calculations against arbitrary Drupal entities. Its goal is to
provide a central place for calculating similarities for other modules
to use.

<h3>Properties of a Similarity Object</h3>
<dl>
	<dt><a href="&topic:similarity/conditions&">Conditions</a></dt>
	<dd>Conditions provide means to filter the resulting objects allowing
		similarity calculations only to happen on objects that match the
		conditions against all other objects that match the same
		condition.
	</dd>
	<dt><a href="&topic:similarity/tokens&">Tokens</a></dt>
	<dd>Tokens are the actual pieces of information used for the
		similarity calculation. Common examples are the search index,
		taxonomy terms and votes. These tokens can then be transformed into
		other tokens.
